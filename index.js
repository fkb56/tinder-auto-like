/**
 * Tinder Auto Like
 * Author: Paolo Carrara
 * 
 * This is a simple js script for people that like me does not care for what I'm liking on Tinder,
 * because if I dont't like the match I just go and unmatch it. That simple.
 * 
 * If you are subscriber of one of Tinder's plans that gives you infinite likes you can just use this script
 * to like everyone. They say you can like an 'unlimited' number of times, don't take that as granted as I already
 * got 429 (Too Many Requests) code after some thousands.
 * 
 * Anyway, go have fun and don't take Tinder very serious, it's full of retarde people, including me.
